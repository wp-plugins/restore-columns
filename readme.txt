The plugin restores the possibility to select the number of columns displayed on the dashboard.

== Description ==

In WordPress 3.8, the setting that controlled the number of displayed columns was removed from the "Screen Options" section of the Dashboard. From now on, WordPress decides how many columns it should display depending on the size of the browser window. This is convenient for mobile use, but not for a web browser maximized to the entire size of a 22-27 inch monitor, since WordPress always shows 4 columns in this case – even if only 2 widgets are shown.

This plugin restores the possibility to control the "Number of Columns" parameter in the "Screen Options" section of the Dashboard.


PS Please note that WordPress doesn’t allow you to select more than 2 columns if your browser window is not maximized.
